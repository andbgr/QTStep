How to create a new variation of this theme:

1) use make_color_scheme.sh to create a colors.* file from a KDE color scheme
   that will contain border/highlight/etc shades, for example:

       ./make_color_scheme.sh ~/.local/share/color-schemes/MyColorScheme.colors

2) [optional] edit the resulting colors.* file to manually change some of the
   shades. if you only want to specify a few of the colors (for example the 
   titlebar gradient) while leaving the rest up to the script (in this example
   maybe the titlebar gradient's highlight and innerdark borders), use
   override.colors.*, put in only the colors you want to specify, then run 1)
   again.

3) run
       ./make_theme.sh colors.MyColorScheme
